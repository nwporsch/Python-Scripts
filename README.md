# Python-Scripts
This repo provides a list of basic scripts I have created to help with general tasks in my life

##Organize Folder
The script will take in a folder and will organize the files based on if the file is a document or
an image file. Currently, only supports .doc, .pdf, .txt, .png ,but can be easily modified for more 
file extensions.

## File Summarizer
Current script that I am working on that will be able to read in a file such as a .doc, .pdf, .txt and
provide a summary of the files contents.
